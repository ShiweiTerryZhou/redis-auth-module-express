    - GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/redisApi/v0.3/adminusers : this is the protected routing for users

Fun with login and protected routing:

    - use postman to play with all different kinds of requests, since there is no front end. You can do POST on browser only.

    - use POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/redisApi/v0.3/login with request:

    {
        "username":"root",
        "password":"root"
    }

    you will get response with element token.

    - go GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/redisApi/v0.3/adminusers with header of : key: authorization, value: [the token you receied from last step]

    - congrats, you got into the protected routing as admin
